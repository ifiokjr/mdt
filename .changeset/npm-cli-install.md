# Publish the CLI through npm packages

`mdt` now has an official npm distribution channel. Releases prepare a top-level `@m-d-t/cli` package plus platform-specific binary packages for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Users can install the CLI globally with npm or run it on demand through npx, making adoption easier in JavaScript-heavy projects and environments that do not already have Rust tooling installed.
